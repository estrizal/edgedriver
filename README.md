# msedgedriver

Use pip install msedgedriver to install it
and then use msedgedriver.install() to get msedgedriver.exe (your webdriver) in the directory you were working on.

This project automatically installs the version of selenium ms edge driver suited for your ms edge.  
SO.... whenever you run this .py file. It downloads the right ms edge selenium driver for you!! and nope, i wont be explaining anything as it won't get any reader anyways :)
